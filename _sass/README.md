# Guild, A Jekyll Theme for Your Lab's Website

## Introduction

Guild is a cutomizable Jekyll theme for easily building lab websites. Its development was inspired by the dearth of modern lab websites (_i.e._ updated within the last 5 years). When I was applying for graduate school, these were my first virtual contact with a PI's research. Obviously, research papers are more representative of the interests of a research group, but lab websites help a lot during the first pass.

## Naming

Let's start with the definition of "guild", specifically the second bullet point. "An association of people for mutual aid or the pursuit of a common goal." Don't you find that the definition captures the fraternity of academic labs? 

In fact, I think it would sound so much cooler if we talked about _research guilds_ instead of _research labs_. Alas, I don't think I'll see that change during my lifetime.
