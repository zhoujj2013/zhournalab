  position: Associate Professor
  bio: >
    I am at Dermatology Hospital of <a href="https://www.smu.edu.cn/">Southern Medical University</a> and hold a research position 
    at the genetic center of rare skin disease. I completed my MSc and Ph.D. in genomics and 
    bioinformatics at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html">the Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>. My early research involved 
    massively parallel sequencing to dissect lncRNA and enhancer functions on skeletal muscle satellite cell (MuSCs) differentiation. 
    My current research focuses on the functional implications of RBP (RNA-binding protein)-lncRNA interactions, 
    the molecular mechanisms on epidermal stem cell aging, and biomarker discoveries in diagnosis. 
    I am interested in developing methods to identify non-coding RNA/DNA elements from NGS data, 
    error-corrected sequencing strategies.
