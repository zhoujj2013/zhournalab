- name: Molecular mechanism of epigenetic aberrations on EpiSCs aging
  description: >
    The regeneration ability of epidermal stem cells (EpdSCs) gradually declines with age, 
    eventually leading to the age-related decline of skin functions. The project aims to prioritize 
    critical regulators in the gene regulatory network involved transcription factors (TFs), enhancers 
    and ECM genes in EpdSCs with age through integrating multi-omics datasets.

- name: Molecular mechanism of RBP-lncRNA interaction on subcellular localization
  description: >
    Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a vital role in various biological processes. 
    RNA binding protein (RBP) binds to lncRNAs and directs them to act their functions 
    in a specific subcellular localization. However, the underlying mechanism needs further investigation. 
    In this project, we intend to integrate multi-omics datasets and molecular techniques to 
    study the mechanism of RBP-mediated lncRNA subcellular localization.
